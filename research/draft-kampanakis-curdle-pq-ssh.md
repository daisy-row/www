# Post-quantum public key algorithms for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol

Panos Kampanakis, Douglas Stebila, Markus Friedl, Torben Hansen, Dimitrios Sikeridis. **Post-quantum public key algorithms for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol**. Internet-Draft. *Internet Engineering Task Force*, October 2020.

## Abstract

This document defines hybrid key exchange methods based on classical ECDH key exchange and post-quantum key encapsulation schemes. These methods are defined for use in the SSH Transport Layer Protocol. It also defines post-quantum public key authentication methods based on post-quantum signature schemes. These methods are defined for use in the SSH Authentication Protocol.
